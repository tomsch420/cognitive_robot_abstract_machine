"""
Plan Cartesian- or joint-space goals against an isolated, physics-free scratch copy of
the world via Giskard, then play the resulting trajectory back onto the real, physically
simulated MuJoCo world by driving each joint's own position-servo actuator directly.

Giskard never touches the live, physically simulated world under this module: it only
ever ticks against a :func:`copy.deepcopy` of it, so it cannot race
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoSynchronizer`'s own
physics-thread state sync (see :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.equipment`'s own
module docstring). Execution then drives real MuJoCo actuators the same way, so tracking
is genuinely closed-loop against measured physics, not open-loop trajectory replay.

Every motion here, including park and gripper open/close, is planned this way rather
than commanded straight to the target: see :func:`plan_joint_trajectory`'s own
docstring for why commanding a target directly, with no velocity profile at all, lets a
joint move far faster than its real hardware ever could.
