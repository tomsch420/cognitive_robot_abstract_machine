"""
The physical Tracy's left arm picks up a single cube -- pickup only, no place -- wired
the way :mod:`coraplex_real_tracy.demo` wires the physical robot: a Giskard standalone
node is launched, the live world is fetched from a running ``WorldFetcher`` service and
kept in sync via :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.ros.
world_synchronizer.WorldSynchronizer`, and the plan runs under
:attr:`~coraplex.datastructures.enums.ExecutionType.REAL`.

The cube is added to the live, fetched world as a plain
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity.Body`, the same
symbolic-anchor trick :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.stacking.stacking_demo_real`
uses -- it is not a perception result, so the physical cube must already be placed at
:data:`CUBE_X`/:data:`CUBE_Y` by hand before this runs. Once added it is visible in the
same rviz the physical robot renders in (via ``WorldSynchronizer``), so its position can
be checked against the real cube before the pickup runs -- the script pauses for that
check right after spawning it.

Each pick is watched by a SegMind :func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.
event_monitoring.build_pick_monitor` monitor -- support, grasp, lift and pick-up, but
no hole-contact or insertion, since the shapes here are bare bodies with no board model.
Its events stream to the live dashboard at ``http://127.0.0.1:5000`` while the demo
runs, and a per-shape yes/no verdict is logged after each pick.

While a shape is carried to its hole, the left gripper's knuckle joint is watched for
slip: the close is re-commanded a little past fully closed on a fixed period and, if the
fingers then travel past where the grasp first settled, the shape has left the pads (see
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.montessori.gripper_feedback`). Each poll's verdict
is logged, and a slip also shows on the dashboard as a ``GripperSlipEvent``.

Run with (``iai_tracy_description`` and the Giskard/world-fetcher ROS stack must be
running)::

    python -m experiments.tracy_experiments.pickup.pickup_demo_real

Pass ``--record`` to capture a rosbag of the camera, depth camera and joint states for
the duration of the sorting. Bags are written to
:data:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.rosbag_recording.DEFAULT_BAG_DIRECTORY` and keep
one camera frame in :data:`KEEP_EVERY_NTH_FRAME`; both are overridable, see
``--bag-directory`` and ``--keep-every-nth-frame``.

        just transferred the shape's weight onto the fingers and the knuckle is still
