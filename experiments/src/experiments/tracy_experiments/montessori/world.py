"""
Montessori shape-sorting scene built directly on Tracy's own built-in table, instead of
the free-standing table :mod:`~experiments.montessori.world` lays out for a robot with
no table of its own.

Tracy (see :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.robots.tracy.Tracy`) ships a real table as a
fixed part of its own body tree (its
:meth:`~semantic_digital_twin.robots.tracy.Tracy._get_root_body_name` is literally
``"table"``), at whatever height that model actually has -- unlike a fixed-base robot
with no table of its own, which stands next to one this package builds (see
:meth:`~experiments.montessori.world.MontessoriWorld.add_robot_stand`). So this module
does not build (or need) a separate table or robot stand: it only builds the
shape-sorting board and the loose shapes' row, both placed directly on Tracy's own table
surface, reusing every position-independent piece of
:mod:`~experiments.montessori.world` (the board's mesh/hole-cutting, its collision-box
tiling, and the loose shapes' own geometry) the same way
:mod:`~experiments.montessori.world2` does for its own differently-positioned layout.

Tracy is mounted separately, after construction, via
:meth:`~experiments.montessori.world.MontessoriWorld.mount_stationary_robot` (inherited
unchanged) with the position :func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.equipment.tracy_table_mount_position`
computes. This class needs to know the resulting height of Tracy's own table
top *before* that mounting happens (to place the board and shapes on it), so a caller
must compute it first (see :func:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.equipment.tracy_table_mount_position`)
and pass it in as :attr:`TracyMontessoriWorld.table_top_z`.

already parked rather than being swept there live, the board no longer has to clear a
live sweep, only the arms' own *parked-and-settled* geometry -- confirmed directly by
running MuJoCo's own narrow-phase contact check (not just a bounding-box estimate)
between the board and both parked arms at ``x`` values from ``1.15`` down to ``0.60``:
zero contacts at every value tested, since a UR10's own parked wrist links are rounded,
not box-shaped, so their real collision geometry sits well inside their axis-aligned
bounding box. ``0.85`` was chosen inside that contact-free range, roughly halfway to
:const:`SHAPE_ROW_X` rather than at the tested floor, to keep a visible margin for a
shape that overshoots slightly during a place; a full headless sorting run at this
