"""
Contact friction (sliding, torsional, rolling; see
:attr:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoGeom.friction`) given to every
loose shape's collision geometry.

History of the sliding component: started at ``coraplex_panda_demo``'s own ``1.0``
(tuned for a reliable grip between rubber fingertips, which keep their own separate
friction); lowered to ``0.5`` as an experiment to stop a shape landing centered and
upright on a hole's rim from staying stuck there; tried at ``1.0`` again for every shape
except the cube (a per-category override), which over a 90-run batch traded down overall
(blowup-magnitude physics instability jumped from 10% to 39% of runs, and pass rates for
rectangular_hole and circular_hole_2 fell rather than improving) -- so reverted back to
``0.5`` globally.

Now set to ``0.3``: contact friction is combined by MuJoCo as the element-wise maximum
of the two participating geoms, and the shape-sorting board's own collision geometry had
no friction set at all until :data:`BOARD_FRICTION`, defaulting to MuJoCo's own ``1.0``
sliding friction -- so every shape-board contact was silently pinned at ``1.0`` no matter
what this value was tuned to, and every prior experiment here was only ever testing the
finger-shape grip (where the fingertip's own ``~1.0`` friction dominates regardless of
this value), never the rim-sticking interaction it was meant to fix. ``0.3`` approximates
real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces (~0.25-0.4), now paired with
an equally explicit :data:`BOARD_FRICTION` so the shape-board contact can actually drop
below the finger-dominated grip instead of being masked by it.
"""

Per-:class:`~experiments.montessori.semantics.MontessoriShapeCategory` override of

category absent from this mapping (currently all of them) uses :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`.

BOARD_FRICTION = [0.3, 0.005, 0.0001]
"""
Contact friction (sliding, torsional, rolling) given to the shape-sorting board's
collision geometry via :func:`apply_contact_friction`.

Approximates real sliding friction between painted wood/plastic surfaces (~0.25-0.4),
matching :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s own sliding component so the shape-board contact is
governed by this pair rather than by MuJoCo's own ``1.0`` default the board previously
had no override for (see :data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s docstring for why that masked every
prior friction experiment). Torsional and rolling use MuJoCo's own defaults rather than
:data:`GRASP_FRICTION`'s grip-stabilizing multiples of them, since the board is never
pinched between fingers.
"""

GRASP_SOLVER_REFERENCE = [0.005, 1.0]
"""
Contact solver reference (see
:attr:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoGeom.solver_reference`) given to
every loose shape, started from ``coraplex_panda_demo``'s cube (``solref="0.008"``) and
tightened a further step from there.

Stiffer than MuJoCo's own default (``0.02``): a soft contact lets a pinched shape sink
into the fingers and then slip back out as the arm lifts, rather than being held solidly
between them. Confirmed directly on the montessori board: even at ``0.008`` a grasped
piece's own height never left the table across several full episodes -- squeeze force
and squeeze duration both measurably increased first (see :data:`~experiments.
tracy_experiments.trajectory_planning.SQUEEZE_MARGIN`/:data:`~experiments.
tracy_experiments.trajectory_planning.POST_CONTACT_SQUEEZE_TICKS` and :data:`~experi
ments.tracy_experiments.equipment.GRIPPER_JOINT_SERVO`) without changing that outcome,
narrowing this down as the next thing actually worth moving. Kept to a single, modest
step (``0.008`` to ``0.005``, not lower) rather than a larger jump: an earlier,
unrelated over-tuning of :data:`GRASP_FRICTION` in this same file drove physics-blowup
runs from 10% to 39% of a 90-run batch, so a stiffness change here is deliberately
conservative and worth re-checking for the same failure mode before going further.

and raised the lower bound one modest step further -- see :data:`GRASP_SOLVER_REFERENCE`
for why and how far this was pushed, and its own note on staying conservative. The
remaining three values keep MuJoCo's own defaults.

Harder than MuJoCo's own default (``0.9 0.95``), for the same reason as
:data:`GRASP_SOLVER_REFERENCE`.
