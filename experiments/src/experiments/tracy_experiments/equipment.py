Read Tracy's description out of its own ROS package and equip it to be driven by direct
MuJoCo actuator control.

Physically simulating the joints Giskard actively commands, and letting Giskard itself
drive them via ``ParkArmsAction``, was tried first (see
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.parkarms_demo`'s own docstring) and traced to a real
architectural gap: Giskard's own QP control loop reads ``world.state`` as its belief of
the robot's current position, but for a physically simulated DOF that same state is also
written by Giskard's own prior command, not exclusively by MuJoCo's true physics
readback -- so Giskard can be satisfied by its own prior write, not by the robot actually
having moved. Driving the actuators directly via
:meth:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.real_time_simulation.RealTimeSimulation.command`,
and planning Cartesian/joint goals against an isolated scratch copy of the world (see
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.trajectory_planning`) rather than through Giskard's
live closed loop, sidesteps this entirely -- proved out first by the cube-stacking demo.

backs this gripper's own declared limit, so there is no real hardware speed being

still-modest, more usable one.

``1.0`` (not higher) is a real, tested ceiling, not just a round number: pushing this to
``2.0`` was tried first and, confirmed directly by ticking the planner in isolation,
made the QP solver settle about 0.016 rad short of the actual target and stay there
indefinitely, so ``is_end_motion`` never triggers and the plan times out -- ``1.0``

into the fingers and then slip back out as the arm lifts, rather than being held solidly
between them.
