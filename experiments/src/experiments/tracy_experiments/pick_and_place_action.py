"""
:class:`PickUpActionMujoco`/:class:`PlaceActionMujoco`: Mujoco-driven siblings of
:class:`~coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.pick_up.PickUpAction`/
:class:`~coraplex.robot_plans.actions.core.placing.PlaceAction`, matching their own
field interface (``object_designator``, ``arm``, ``grasp_description``/
``target_location``) so a caller can compose them into a
:func:`~coraplex.plans.factories.sequential` plan the same way, but with each own leaf
motion running plain Python (see :meth:`PickUpActionMujoco._run`/
:meth:`PlaceActionMujoco._run`, wrapped via :func:`~coraplex.plans.factories.code`)
rather than a Giskard motion mapping.

The real ``PickUpAction``/``PlaceAction`` build their own plan entirely from
``MoveToolCenterPointMotion``/``MoveGripperMotion`` designators, each of which ticks
Giskard's own closed loop live against the world model
(:class:`~coraplex.robot_plans.motions.gripper.MoveToolCenterPointMotion` →
:class:`~coraplex.plans.plan_node.MotionNode` →
:class:`~coraplex.plans.executables.GiskardExecutable`). That races
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.multi_sim.MujocoSynchronizer`'s own
physics-thread state sync for a physically simulated robot -- see
:mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.equipment`'s own module docstring. These two
actions instead reuse :mod:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.trajectory_planning`'s own
plan-then-execute functions directly: each reach is planned by Giskard against an
isolated scratch copy of the world, then the resulting trajectory is played back by
commanding the real MuJoCo actuators.

Unlike ``PickUpAction``/``PlaceAction``, neither action here kinematically attaches or
detaches the object (no ``AttachNode``/``DetachNode``): the object is held only by real
MuJoCo contact friction between the fingers throughout -- a kinematically snapped object
is not left behind by a friction hold's own continuous motion the way an instantaneous
kinematic detach would otherwise risk. Both actions are generic over any body and arm,
used the same way for a Montessori shape being sorted into a hole and a cube being
stacked onto another.

Both actions currently support only a fixed top-down grasp (``grasp_description`` is
accepted for interface parity with ``PickUpAction``, but its own approach direction and
vertical alignment are not yet read); see :func:`_finger_midpoint_offset`'s own
docstring for the geometry this fixed orientation assumes.

Extra height, in metres, added on top of the object's own vertical centre when reaching
the grasp pose, so the fingertip pads still clear the resting surface after closing.

The pads aren't fixed relative to the tool frame: as the Robotiq-85 knuckle closes, each
pad's own position travels ~1.35cm further out along the gripper's reach axis (measured
directly: pad centre sits at 0.1208m from the gripper mount when open, 0.1343m when
closed) -- confirmed directly, a pad that clears the table by that same ~1.35cm while
open ends up flush with the table once closed. ``0.015`` covers that swing with a small
margin.

Was ``0.0435`` -- nearly 3x this docstring's own derived value -- confirmed directly as
a real bug, not an intentional deviation: for a piece a few centimetres tall (e.g. a
3cm cube, so 1.5cm half-height), reaching 4.35cm above its own centre put the grasp
target *above the piece's own top face entirely*, closing the fingers on whatever sliver
of the piece's upper edge they happened to catch rather than pinching it securely around
its middle. That grip held the piece rock-steady the instant it stopped closing --
gravity alone does not need much from a marginal top-edge pinch -- but let it slip free
as soon as the very next reach put it under any acceleration at all, regardless of how
much squeeze force, gripper servo torque, or contact stiffness the fingers were given
(all already tried; see :data:`~experiments.tracy_experiments.equipment.
