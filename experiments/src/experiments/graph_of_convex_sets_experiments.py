"""
End-to-end performance benchmark for the Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) free- space
pipeline, covering three families of environments:

  * **URDF environments** — rooms loaded from `semantic_digital_twin/resources/urdf`
    via :class:`URDFParser`.

  * **PartNet-Mobility scenes** — articulated objects loaded from
    ``~/partnet-mobility-dataset`` via :class:`PartNetMobilityDatasetLoader`.

  * **Sage10k scenes** — real, multi-room scenes (walls, doors, furniture from PLY
    meshes) downloaded from the ``nvidia/SAGE-10k`` dataset on Hugging Face via
    :class:`Sage10kDatasetLoader`. Optional and off by default, since loading a scene's
    meshes typically takes minutes: ``--sage10k-count`` benchmarks scenes from the
    curated :class:`Sage10kActionableScenes`, and ``--sage10k-random-count`` benchmarks
    additional scenes sampled at random from the full, uncurated dataset.

For all three, the navigable search space is the minimal box covering every obstacle in
the scene, widened by 1 m in x and y (see
:meth:`GraphOfConvexSetsFreespaceBenchmark._compute_minimal_search_space`).

For every environment, both GCS implementations are benchmarked and compared against
a mesh-accurate free-space ground truth:

  * :class:`VolumetricGraphOfBoundingBoxes` exhaustively partitions free space into disjoint
    axis-aligned boxes; its own volume is an exact, always-valid lower bound on the
    true free volume (obstacle bounding boxes only ever over-approximate the real
    geometry).

  * :class:`GraphOfConvexPolygons` grows a handful of possibly-overlapping IRIS
    regions; since their union has no closed-form volume, it is scored via
    :class:`~experiments.free_space_volume_estimation.MonteCarloFreeSpaceSampler`
    against the same sample points used for the ground truth.

Results are collected into :class:`GraphOfConvexSetsFreespaceExperimentResult`
rows and printed as a Typst ``#table`` block.  All timing columns report
wall-clock milliseconds; repeated phases show mean ± standard deviation over
three runs.
