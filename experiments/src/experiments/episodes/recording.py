"""
Whether and where a run keeps the trials it finishes.

Recording is best effort: a run whose database will not take a write goes on running and
says so, rather than losing a finished run to a database problem.
:func:`~experiments.montessori.results_database.main` reports the same thing before a
world has been built, where it costs a fraction of a second rather than a minute.
