"""Generate real SDT objects with sampled masses for the confidence-aware pipeline.

The confidence model needs a population of "familiar" objects to fit on. Rather than
hand-authoring them, this module drives EQL's :class:`ProbabilisticBackend` with a
nested query on a class' root body inertial mass, so it constructs real objects
(``Cup``, ``Pot``, ...) whose mass is drawn from a chosen Gaussian.
