"""
This module measures how much of a curved region an axis-aligned representation
captures, and what capturing more of it costs.

A predicate thresholding a Euclidean distance describes a ball, and no box is a ball.
But an :class:`~random_events.product_algebra.Event` is a *union* of boxes rather than a
single box, so the fraction of a ball its representation captures is not fixed:
subdividing the region into more boxes captures more of it. The fidelity a survey
reports for such a predicate is therefore a consequence of how many boxes it spends, not
a limit of the representation.

What this measures is the exchange rate between the two: for a ball and for a disc, how
close to the region a covering union of boxes gets, and how many simple sets that takes.

The approximation is always a *covering* one -- every point of the region lies in it --
so a condition represented this way is never satisfied by fewer states than it should
be, and the fidelity reported is a ratio no greater than one.
