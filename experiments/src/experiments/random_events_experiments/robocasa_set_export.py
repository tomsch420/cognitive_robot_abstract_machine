"""
This module exports RoboCasa's own ground truth for what a scene or a task admits, for a
curated set of tasks.

RoboCasa states this admissible information in whatever form its own implementation
happens to use: a placement region as sampler parameters (a reference pose plus local
ranges), a gripper exclusion zone as a body position and a threshold, a fixture's open
or closed state as a normalized position on a MuJoCo joint, a device's state as an entry
in a plain dictionary. Reading a candidate representation's fidelity directly off those
forms would tie the ground truth to whatever RoboCasa happens to store internally.

The two Cartesian tracks -- placement regions and gripper exclusion zones -- are
therefore attached to a :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world.World` as
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity.Region`\\ s, in exactly the
shape model (:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.geometry.Box`,
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.geometry.Sphere`) the rest of that world
already uses, via
:mod:`semantic_digital_twin.adapters.robocasa_dataset.region_extraction`. The remaining
two tracks -- joint openness and discrete device state -- are not shapes at all, so they
are read directly into plain intervals and values instead.

For placement regions, this module additionally measures how faithfully an axis-aligned
:mod:`random_events` representation captures that ground truth: a region's oriented
rectangle is compared, by intersection over union, against the smallest axis-aligned box
that contains it -- the only shape :class:`~random_events.product_algebra.Event` can
express. Gripper exclusion zones are spheres, which no union of axis-aligned boxes can
represent tightly, and approximating those is deliberately left for a later step. Joint
openness and discrete device state are not shapes at all, so they are read directly into
plain intervals and values instead, with no approximation to measure.
