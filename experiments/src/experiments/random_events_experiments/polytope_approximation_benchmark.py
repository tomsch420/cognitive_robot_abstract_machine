Benchmark for :meth:`~random_events.polytope.Polytope.inner_box_approximation` and
:meth:`~random_events.polytope.Polytope.outer_box_approximation` on 2D and 3D
polytopes.

Polytopes are convex hulls of random point clouds sampled on/within a sphere shell,
which gives well-conditioned full-dimensional polytopes with a controllable number of
facets (more points -> more facets, up to the O(n^floor(d/2)) facet blow-up of random
points on a sphere for higher dimensions -- not relevant here since we only use d in
{2, 3}).
