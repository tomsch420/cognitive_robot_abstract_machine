Build a semantic digital twin world for the Montessori shape-sorting scene: a floor
carrying a table with a shape-sorting board (with its holes and drawers) and the loose
shapes that are dropped through the holes, and (optionally) a robot standing in front of
it.

The scene is constructed directly with the semantic digital twin API (bodies, regions,
