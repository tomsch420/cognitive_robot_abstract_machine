"""
The Montessori sorting scenes, and the scripted runs over them, as instances of the
scenario domain model.

A scene is a :class:`PieceLayout` — which pieces stand on the table, where, and turned
how far — and a run is what is then done to it. The two compose: every run here takes a
layout, so a random scene and a near-ambiguous one are the same four scripts over
different scenes rather than eight scenarios. What the layout stands its pieces in is a
:class:`MontessoriWorldBuilder` the scenario is given, so the same scripts run on the
board this package builds and on the one a demo brings with it.

Every run is carried in MuJoCo (:class:`SimulatedScene`), and what a step does it does
through the simulation: a scene comes to rest because gravity settles it, a piece is
shoved because a body runs into it, and a piece goes through a hole because it falls
through it. What the robot does it does through coraplex's own actions, which giskard
executes as motions. What a goal then reads it reads with the twin's own predicates
rather than by measuring the scene itself.
