"""
Alternate layout for the Montessori shape-sorting scene: the shape-sorting board sits
directly in front of the mounted robot, and the loose shapes sit off to its side on
their own stand, instead of both sharing the single table :mod:`~experiments.montessori.world`
lays them out on.

:mod:`~experiments.montessori.world` is left untouched (this is a separate, parallel
layout to compare against it, not a replacement); :class:`MontessoriWorld2` subclasses
its :class:`~experiments.montessori.world.MontessoriWorld`, reusing every
position-independent piece (the board's mesh/hole-cutting, its collision-box tiling, the
loose shapes' own geometry, and the base class's spawning/robot-mounting machinery) and
only overriding the three methods that place things on the scene.

Whether separating the two regions actually helps was itself the open question this
layout exists to test: :mod:`~experiments.montessori.world`'s single table packs the
loose-shape row and the board into the same, fairly narrow strip in front of the robot,
so a pick and the following place can both sit near the edge of a comfortable reach
envelope at once. Here the board sits on its own stand straight ahead of the robot, and
the loose shapes sit tangentially arranged (same distance from the robot, varying
side-to-side rather than near/far) on a separate stand off to the robot's side, so a
pick mostly turns the robot's base joint while a place mostly extends its arm, rather
than needing a bit of both at every step.
