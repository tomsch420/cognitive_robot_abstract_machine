# Creating Custom Bodies

The tutorial demonstrates the creation of a body and its visual and collision information.
First, let's create a world.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from importlib.resources import files
from pathlib import Path

from semantic_digital_twin.datastructures.prefixed_name import PrefixedName
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import HomogeneousTransformationMatrix, RotationMatrix
from semantic_digital_twin.world import World
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity import Body

world = World()
```

Next, let's create the visual and collision information for our body.

The collision describes the geometry to use when calculating collision relevant things, for instance if your robot is colliding with a table while moving.
The visual information is purely for esthetics.
Both of these are collections of shapes.

Supported Shapes are:
- Box
- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Mesh

Finally, in our kinematic structure, each entity has a name. For this we can use a simple datastructure called `PrefixedName`. You always need to provide a name, but the prefix is optional. This is for human readability and allows for easy identification of entities. For uniqueness constraints, a UUID is used and stored in the `id` field.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types import Point3, Vector3
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.shape_collection import ShapeCollection
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.geometry import Box, Scale, Sphere, Cylinder, Mesh, Color

box_origin = HomogeneousTransformationMatrix.from_xyz_rpy(x=0, y=0, z=0, roll=0, pitch=0, yaw=0)
box = Box(origin=box_origin, scale=Scale(1., 1., 0.5), color=Color(1., 0., 0., 1., ))

sphere_origin = HomogeneousTransformationMatrix.from_xyz_quaternion(pos_x=0, pos_y=1., pos_z=1., quat_x=0., quat_y=0., quat_z=0.,
                                                   quat_w=1.)
sphere = Sphere(origin=sphere_origin, radius=0.4)

cylinder_origin = HomogeneousTransformationMatrix.from_point_rotation_matrix(point=Point3.from_iterable([1, -1, 2]),
                                                                  rotation_matrix=RotationMatrix.from_axis_angle(
                                                                      Vector3.from_iterable([1., 0., 0.]), 0.8, ),)
cylinder = Cylinder(origin=cylinder_origin, width=0.05, height=0.5)

mesh = Mesh(origin=HomogeneousTransformationMatrix(),
            filename=os.path.join(Path(files("semantic_digital_twin")).parent.parent, "resources", "stl", "milk.stl"))

collision = ShapeCollection([cylinder, sphere, box])
visual = ShapeCollection([mesh])
body = Body(name=PrefixedName("my first body", "my first prefix"), visual=visual, collision=collision)
```

When modifying your world, keep in mind that you need to open a `world.modify_world()` whenever you want to add or remove things to/from your world

```{code-cell} ipython3
with world.modify_world():
    world.add_body(body)

from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_computations.raytracer import RayTracer
rt = RayTracer(world)
rt.update_scene()
rt.scene.show("jupyter")
```

```{warning}
Using the above method to visualize your world only really makes sense in a notebook setting like this.
If you want learn how to properly visualize your worlds, check out the [](visualizing-worlds) tutorial.
```

```{warning}
If you are trying to create multiple bodies without connecting them,
you will run into trouble with the world validation.
