"""
The rules of the world semantic-annotation classifier.

Each rule returns every annotation of one type. Everything that opens is recognised from
the kinematic structure alone, as a query over the joints; body names are read only for
the kinds no joint distinguishes, and then through the annotation classes' own vocabulary
(:meth:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity.WorldEntity.class_name_tokens`
and ``_synonyms``) rather than through literals spelled here.

.. note:: The rules live beside the classifier rather than inside it because the
    classifier rebuilds each rule from the imports of
    ``world_semantic_annotations_mcrdr_defs``, so a rule has to be importable to be
    callable from there.
