"""The three.js release used for the separately loaded ``GLTFLoader``.

Pinned to the newest release that still ships the classic, non-module
``examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js`` (three.js moved to ES-modules-only examples at 0.148.0, and
dropped the classic ``build/three.min.js`` UMD bundle entirely at 0.161.0); the page template loads
scripts as plain ``<script>`` tags with no bundler or import map. Needs to be recent enough for
Object3D compatibility with whatever three.js 3d-force-graph bundles internally — 0.128.0 (pre
r133) caused ``TypeError: e.removeFromParent is not a function`` when 3d-force-graph tried to add a
loaded mesh to the scene, since it bundles a newer three.js than that. Kept separate from the base
class rather than shared: the base class's node labels are plain DOM overlays now (no separate
three.js needed there at all) after ``three-spritetext``'s Sprite-based approach ran into a similar
but *unfixable* version mismatch — 3d-force-graph's internal three.js bundle is newer than any
release that still ships a classic (non-module) build, and Sprite materials are compiled against
shader chunks that must match exactly, unlike plain meshes/geometries loaded through GLTFLoader,
which tolerate the version gap fine.
