"""
This module reads geometric ground truth that only exists as RoboCasa's own runtime
state -- a placement sampler's resolved rectangle, a success condition's gripper
exclusion zone -- and attaches it to a :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world.World` as a
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity.Region` carrying a
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.semantic_annotations.semantic_annotations.PlacementArea`
or
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.semantic_annotations.semantic_annotations.GripperExclusionZone`
annotation, so both the shape and what it means to the task live in the same model as
everything else the world already represents, instead of a parallel, adapter specific
format.

Unlike :class:`~semantic_digital_twin.adapters.robocasa_dataset.loader.RoboCasaDatasetLoader`,
this module does not know which tasks or bodies are of interest: it is handed an already
resolved value (a sampler, or a body name and a radius) and turns it into an annotated
Region. Deciding which values are worth reading is left to the caller.
