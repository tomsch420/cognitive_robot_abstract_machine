"""
Backward inference for EQL-RDR rule trees.

Given a target conclusion value (e.g. ``Species.molusc``), traverse the rule-tree
(The rules form a tree, but if you look at the level of the used expressions, it is
a directed acyclic graph)
backwards to enumerate every rule path that could produce it. Each path accumulates
*guard conditions* from the ``Refinement``/``Alternative``/``Next`` selectors and wraps
the result as a :class:`SufficientConditionSet`. The full answer is the disjunction of all
such sets (a DNF formula).

This is backward chaining — goal-directed reasoning that works backwards through the
rule tree, the inverse of forward evaluation / classification.
