"""
Exhaustive verbalization-surface verification for any package.

Point a :class:`SymbolicSurfaceSnapshot` at a package and a committed list of
:class:`VerbalizationSurface` entries. Its three ``assert_*`` methods, used as the bodies of three
tests, check that every concrete symbolic callable the package defines (1) implements its own
verbalization fragment, (2) has a declared surface, and (3) renders exactly its declared sentence —
so a new predicate or function, or a changed shared surface builder, cannot slip through unreviewed.

The same three-line test works for any package that defines
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.predicate.SymbolicCallable` subclasses (krrood itself,
``semantic_digital_twin``, ``coraplex``, …): the discovery, placeholder operands, and rendering all
live here.
