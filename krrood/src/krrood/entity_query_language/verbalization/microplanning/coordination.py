"""
Coordination — the conjunction-reduction (aggregation) microplanning task.

Two stages live here, top to bottom:

* **EQL-level conjunct reduction** — the :class:`ConjunctReducer` pass folds a flat conjunct list
  (e.g. an ``AND``'s operands) into one where recognizable groups become first-class fold *artifacts*
  (:class:`RangeFold`, :class:`CoindexedFold`) that the grammar then renders. Each fold is a
  :class:`ConjunctFold` strategy in the reducer's ordered registry — adding a fold is a new strategy,
  nothing else changes (open/closed). This is the *one* place a caller goes to simplify conjuncts.
* **VerbalizationFragment-level coordination builders** — :func:`build_between` and :func:`oxford_comma`
  (re-exported from the fragment layer) assemble already-rendered pieces into a coordinated phrase.

References: :cite:t:`reiter2000building` and :cite:t:`dalianis1999aggregation` — aggregation realised via coordination /
conjunction reduction.
