    Resolution order:

    1. *node*'s own type noun, when its type is informative (a concrete class other than the bare
       ``object`` placeholder) — the type is the default identifier for a referring expression
       (Dale & Reiter's Incremental Algorithm includes the type attribute unconditionally) and
       *always* wins once known, so a genuinely typed operand (``HasType(a_body, Apple)`` →
       *"a Body"*) is never overridden by a field's metadata;
    2. only once the type carries no information: the owning predicate field's declared
       :attr:`~krrood.patterns.field_metadata.GrammarMetadata.display_name` — explicit lexical
       metadata, checked only when *node* fills exactly that one field and appears nowhere else
       (:func:`_sole_predicate_field`);
    3. the sole owning field's name itself (verbatim, underscores read as spaces), when no
       metadata is declared either;
    4. ``"object"`` as the last resort (no sole field at all).

    A variable referenced anywhere besides that one field (a query subject, an
    ``==``-constrained pair) never reaches steps 2 or 3 — it always keeps its type-named identity,
    because a tracked entity is identified by its category, not by the role it happens to fill

    A sole predicate field only ever supplies a noun once the type gives none — a typed operand
    keeps its type noun even filling a field of ``IsReachable`` (whose ``location`` field is
    declared ``object``, an uninformative type on its own):

    >>> reachable = IsReachable(variable(Robot, []), variable(Robot, []))
    >>> operand_head_noun(variable(Robot, []), [ParentEdge(reachable, "location")])

    the field name itself, else to ``"object"`` once there is no sole field to name it by:

    >>> operand_head_noun(variable(object, []), [ParentEdge(reachable, "location")])
    'location'
    >>> operand_head_noun(variable(object, []), [])
    'object'

    A variable reachable through more than one edge is not a sole predicate operand, so it never
    reads a field name — only its type, or ``"object"`` as the last resort:
