    Resolve every referring noun phrase in document order (first / repeat / pronoun) — the one
    place the discourse (coreference) decision is made.

    A referring expression is named differently each time it appears: an indefinite first mention
    (*"a Robot"*), a definite subsequent mention (*"the Robot"*), or a pronoun (*"its …"*) when it
    is the current discourse subject. Rules emit the first-mention form; this pass walks the
    finished tree in document order, tracking which referents have been introduced and which is
    the current subject, and downgrades every repeat mention to a definite reference (dropping the
    first-mention modifiers, keeping the head label) or a pronoun.

    Stateful per pass: the walk threads ``_seen`` and ``_subject_stack``.
