    Reference: Reiter & Dale (2000) — aggregation / clause structuring; Gatt & Reiter (2009),

    A grouped set-of *report* fronts its grouping as *"For each <key>, report …"* in the query
    assembler, so this clause is used for the in-query weave (*"and the <aggregated> are grouped by
    …"*) and bare grouped-by nodes.
