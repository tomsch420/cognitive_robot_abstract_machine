"""
Predicate realization — how a comparator/condition is said as a *predicate*.

This is the predicate counterpart of the surface-form toolkit in
:class:`~…conditions.assembler.ConditionAssembler`: the assembler's ``predicate`` dispatches over the
:class:`PredicateTransform` registry here (mirroring how the query assembler dispatches over
``query/ranking.py``), so the generic *"<left> <op> <right>"* is one transform alongside the absence
(*"has no …"*) and boolean-polarity (*"is [not] <attr>"*) forms — adding a predicate form is a new
subclass, nothing else changes (open/closed). The operator-word selection
(:func:`comparator_operator`, :func:`coindexed_operator`) and the absence rendering
(:func:`render_absence`) live here too, since they are the lower-level pieces a predicate is built
from.
