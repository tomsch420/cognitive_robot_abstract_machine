"""
Example domain classes for the EQL verbalization documentation.

These small dataclasses are the *domain* that the verbalization user guide
(:doc:`/eql/user/verbalization`) queries over — *"Find a Robot whose battery is
greater than 50"*, *"the sum of amounts among BankTransactions …"*, and so on.

They live here, under ``src``, for one reason: Sphinx AutoAPI documents this
module like any other, so the source-link resolver
(:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.verbalization.rendering.source_link_resolver.AutoAPIResolver`)
resolves the class/attribute hyperlinks in the rendered examples to real AutoAPI
pages — both on the published GitHub Pages site and in a locally built docs tree —
with no hand-maintained mock API.

They are illustrative only: not used by the verbalization engine itself, and safe
to import without side effects.  Grouped by the doc section that uses them.

Canonical class list (the single source of truth;
``test_example_domain.py::_EXAMPLE_CLASSES`` enforces that this stays in sync):

* Robots & missions — ``Robot``, ``Mission``
* Boolean & list attributes — ``Task``, ``Worker``
* Money (aggregation / nested / dates) — ``AmountDetails``, ``BankTransaction``
* Employees (disambiguation / grouping / having) — ``Employee``
* Custom predicates — ``Location``, ``IsReachable``, ``Department``, ``StaffMember``, ``WorksIn``
* Birds (rule-tree / inference) — ``Bird``, ``LoveBirds``, ``BirdView``, ``StrongLoveBird``,
  ``WeakLoveBird``
* Containers (deep-nesting rule trees) — ``Handle``, ``Container``, ``FixedConnection``,
  ``PrismaticConnection``, ``Drawer``, ``Cabinet``
