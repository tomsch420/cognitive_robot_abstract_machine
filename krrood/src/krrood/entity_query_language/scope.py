"""
Definition-scope capture for the Entity Query Language.

When an underspecified query (or any EQL variable/query) is created, we often need
to recover the *caller's* namespace later — for example, to drive an interactive
expert shell whose globals/locals mirror the code that built the query.

This reuses the same ``inspect``-based technique as the monitoring/creation-stack
infrastructure (:mod:`krrood.entity_query_language._monitoring`,
:mod:`krrood.entity_query_language._stack`), but snapshots the namespace of the
*first user frame* — i.e. the frame outside the EQL package and outside installed
site-packages — which is "where the query was defined".
