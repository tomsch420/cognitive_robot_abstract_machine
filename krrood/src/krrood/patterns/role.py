@dataclass(eq=False)
class Role(Symbol, SubClassSafeGeneric[T]):
    """
    Base class for the Role design pattern.

    A role adds context-specific attributes and behaviour to an existing object (the *role
    taker*) without altering the role taker's identity. A role is an ordinary object with
    its own identity: it is equal only to itself and is **not** equal to its role taker. To
    ask whether two objects refer to the same underlying entity, use the :class:`IsSameEntity
    <krrood.patterns.role_predicates.IsSameEntity>` predicate.

    **Pure composition.** A role class must not inherit from its role taker type. Role
    membership is expressed through :meth:`has_role` and :meth:`roles_for`, not through
    ``isinstance`` checks. Constructing a role always requires the role taker to be passed
    explicitly.

    **Defining a role.** Inherit from ``Role[T]`` (where ``T`` is the role taker type),
    decorate with ``@dataclass(eq=False)``, and mark exactly one field as the role taker with
    :func:`role_taker_field`. Add any role-specific fields alongside it.

    **Attribute access.** Reading an attribute that is not declared on the role is delegated
    to the role taker via ``__getattr__`` (role-native attributes are resolved first).
    Assignments always set the attribute on the role itself and never modify the role taker:
    only the role's own declared fields may be assigned, and any other name raises
    :class:`RoleAttributeNotDeclaredError
    <krrood.patterns.exceptions.RoleAttributeNotDeclaredError>`. To change the role taker,
    assign through ``role.role_taker``.

    **Distinct identity.** A role is a distinct object from its role taker: they do not
    compare equal and do not share a hash, so multiple roles (even of the same type) on one
    taker stay distinct in sets and dicts. Semantic equivalence ("same underlying entity")
    is expressed through the :class:`IsSameEntity
    <krrood.patterns.role_predicates.IsSameEntity>` predicate, which unwraps roles to their
    :attr:`root_persistent_entity`:
    >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
    >>> from krrood.patterns.role_predicates import IsSameEntity
    >>> @dataclass(unsafe_hash=True)
    ... class Person:
    ...     name: str
    >>> @dataclass(eq=False)
    ... class Student(Role[Person]):
    ...     person: Person = role_taker_field()
    ...     major: str = ""
    >>> person = Person(name="Alice")
    >>> student = Student(person=person)
    >>> student.name is person.name
    True
    >>> person == student
    False
    >>> person is student
    False
    >>> len({person, student})
    2
    >>> bool(IsSameEntity(person, student))
    True
