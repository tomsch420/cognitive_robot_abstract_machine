# Role Pattern — User Guide

The Role pattern lets an existing object take on a new semantic context — adding context-specific
attributes and behaviour — while leaving the original object untouched. A role is an **ordinary
object with its own identity**: it is equal only to itself, never to its role taker. When you need
to ask whether two objects refer to the same underlying entity, use the `IsSameEntity` predicate,
which sees through role chains to the root entity.

This guide uses a university ontology as its running example. A `Person` is a persistent entity
with a name. Over time that person may become a `CEO` or a `Professor`. These are roles: they
add context-specific data, but the person's identity never changes.

## Defining a Role Taker

A role taker is any dataclass you define.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing_extensions import List

from krrood.entity_query_language.predicate import Symbol
from krrood.patterns.role_predicates import IsSameEntity


@dataclass(eq=False)
class Person(Symbol):
    """A persistent human entity with a unique name."""

    name: str

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self.name)


@dataclass(eq=False)
class Company(Symbol):
    """An organisation that people can head or work for."""

    name: str

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self.name)


@dataclass(eq=False)
class Course(Symbol):
    """An academic course that a professor can teach."""

    name: str

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self.name)


alice = Person(name="Alice")
print(alice)
```

## Defining a Role

A role is a dataclass that inherits from `Role[T]`, where `T` is the type of its role taker.
The role taker is stored in a single field that you mark with `role_taker_field()`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from krrood.patterns.role import Role, role_taker_field


@dataclass(eq=False)
class CEO(Role[Person]):
    """The role of being the chief executive of a company."""

    person: Person = role_taker_field()
    head_of: Company = None
```

Notice that `CEO` inherits from `Role[Person]` — it does **not** inherit from
`Person`. The role and its taker are entirely separate classes connected only through the
`role_taker_field`.

## Constructing a Role

Role construction is explicit. You pass the role taker as a keyword argument to the role's
constructor, just like any other dataclass field.

```{code-cell} ipython3
acme = Company(name="ACME")
ceo = CEO(person=alice, head_of=acme)
print(ceo)
```

The role registers itself with the `SymbolGraph` during `__post_init__`, which is what enables role lookup and
reasoning.

## Distinct Identity

A role is a distinct object from its role taker: they do not compare equal and do not share a
hash, so a role and its taker — and multiple roles on one taker — stay separate in sets and
dictionaries.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("alice == ceo:", alice == ceo)
print("alice is ceo:", alice is ceo)
print("set size:", len({alice, ceo}))
```

To ask whether two objects refer to the same underlying entity, use the `IsSameEntity`
predicate. It unwraps any role to its root entity before comparing, so a role and its taker
count as the same entity:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("IsSameEntity(alice, ceo):", bool(IsSameEntity(alice, ceo)))
```

## Attribute Delegation

Attributes that are not declared on the role are automatically delegated to the role taker via
`__getattr__`. You can read and write role-taker attributes through the role as if they were
declared there.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Reading a role-taker attribute through the role
print("ceo.name:", ceo.name)

# Writing a role-taker attribute through the role modifies the taker
ceo_person_before = alice.name
ceo.name = "Alicia"
print("alice.name after writing through ceo:", alice.name)

# Restore the original name
alice.name = ceo_person_before

# Role-native attributes live on the role, not the taker
print("ceo.head_of:", ceo.head_of)
print("hasattr(alice, 'head_of'):", hasattr(alice, "head_of"))
```

## IDE Support: Python Role Lens

Because a role's attributes come from two places — the fields declared on the role class and,
through delegation, the attributes of its role-taker chain — a standard IDE only sees the
fields declared directly on the role class. The **Python Role Lens** plugin for JetBrains IDEs
(such as PyCharm) closes that gap: it surfaces *all* attributes accessible on a role, including
the delegated ones, and lets you navigate straight to the source class that defines each
attribute — much like navigating an inheritance hierarchy.

## Querying Roles

`Role` provides class methods for checking whether a role taker has a role and for retrieving
role instances.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Check whether alice has a CEO role
print("has CEO role:", Role.has_role(alice, CEO))

# Retrieve all CEO roles for alice
ceos = Role.roles_for(alice, CEO)
print("CEO roles:", ceos)

# Retrieve all roles of any type
all_roles = Role.roles_for(alice)
print("all roles:", all_roles)
```

## Parallel Roles

A single role taker can hold multiple roles simultaneously. Each role is a separate object with
its own identity, but all of them resolve to the same underlying entity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@dataclass(eq=False)
class Professor(Role[Person], Symbol):
    """The role of being an academic who teaches courses."""

    person: Person = role_taker_field()
    teaches: List[Course] = field(default_factory=list, kw_only=True)


cs_101 = Course(name="CS 101")
professor = Professor(person=alice, teaches=[cs_101])

print("ceo == professor:", ceo == professor)
print("IsSameEntity(ceo, professor):", bool(IsSameEntity(ceo, professor)))
print("IsSameEntity(professor, alice):", bool(IsSameEntity(professor, alice)))
print("set size:", len({alice, ceo, professor}))

# Each role preserves its own context-specific data
print("CEO heads:", ceo.head_of)
print("Professor teaches:", professor.teaches)

# The taker knows about every role it currently holds
print("all roles of alice:", Role.roles_for(alice))
```

## Multiple Roles of the Same Type

Because roles are distinct objects, a taker can hold several roles of the *same* type without
them collapsing into one. Each is retrievable from the taker and keeps its own data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
globex = Company(name="Globex")
ceo_of_globex = CEO(person=alice, head_of=globex)

# Both CEO roles are kept and returned
same_type_roles = Role.roles_for(alice, CEO)
print("number of CEO roles:", len(same_type_roles))
print("companies headed:", sorted(role.head_of.name for role in same_type_roles))

# They are distinct objects, yet the same underlying entity
print("ceo is ceo_of_globex:", ceo is ceo_of_globex)
print("IsSameEntity(ceo, ceo_of_globex):", bool(IsSameEntity(ceo, ceo_of_globex)))
```

## Role Chaining

A role's role taker can itself be a role. This lets you layer multiple levels of semantic
context onto the same entity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@dataclass(eq=False)
class Representative(Role[CEO]):
    """The role of a CEO acting as a representative of their company."""

    ceo: CEO = role_taker_field()
    represents: Company = None


rep = Representative(ceo=ceo, represents=acme)

print("rep == ceo:", rep == ceo)
print("IsSameEntity(rep, ceo):", bool(IsSameEntity(rep, ceo)))
print("IsSameEntity(rep, alice):", bool(IsSameEntity(rep, alice)))
print("set size:", len({alice, ceo, professor, rep}))
```

The chain is transparent. Querying from any point in the chain resolves all the way back to
the root entity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Check roles from the perspective of the root taker
print("alice has Representative role:", Role.has_role(alice, Representative))
print(
    "Representative roles of alice:",
    Role.roles_for(alice, Representative),
)

# Navigate the chain programmatically
print("rep.role_taker:", rep.role_taker)
print("rep.root_persistent_entity:", rep.root_persistent_entity)
print("root type:", Representative.get_root_role_taker_type())
```

## The `from_role_taker` Factory

When you do not have extra role-specific data to supply at construction time, you can use the
`from_role_taker` class method. It constructs the role by passing only the role taker.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Equivalent to CEO(person=alice) when no role-native fields need values up front
new_ceo = CEO.from_role_taker(alice)
print("new_ceo:", new_ceo)
```

## When to Use the Role Pattern

- An object needs context-specific attributes that do not logically belong to the original type.
- The additional context is temporary or situational — the entity may gain and lose the role
  over its lifetime.
- The same entity can play multiple semantic roles simultaneously.
- Any part of the system must be able to ask "does this entity have role X?" without scanning
  all instances.
- The role and the original object should be recognisable as the same underlying entity (via
  `IsSameEntity`) while remaining distinct objects.

## When Not to Use the Role Pattern

- The new class changes the permanent, identifying properties of the original. If a `Fruit`
  cannot exist without being an `Apple`, subclassing `Apple` from `Fruit` is the right choice.
- The new class has its own independent persistent identity.
- You never need to relate the two objects back to a shared underlying entity.
