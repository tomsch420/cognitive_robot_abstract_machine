"""
Scaffolding shared by real-world robot demonstrations.

A demonstration acquires a world, populates it with the objects it manipulates and
performs one plan against it. The parts that do not vary between demonstrations -- ROS
session ownership, fetching the world from a running controller and wrapping execution in
the right environment -- live here, so a demonstration only writes its own scene and plan.
