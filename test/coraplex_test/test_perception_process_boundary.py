"""
The RoboKudo perception source against a pipeline running in its own process.

Everything else about perception is covered in ``test_perception.py`` against a stand-in
node inside the test's own interpreter, which shares an rclpy context with the client.
This is the only test where the pipeline is discovered across a real process boundary,
and so the only one that exercises what happens on the robot: cross-context discovery,
and the ``server_timeout`` budget that a locally created server never makes the client
spend.
