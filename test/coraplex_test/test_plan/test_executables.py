"""
Tests for the motion state chart a ``GiskardExecutable`` owns (see
``coraplex/src/coraplex/plans/executables.py``).

The chart is created once while the plan is parsed and only extended afterwards: parsing
adds a goal per plan node and a task per motion, and ``prepare_for_execution`` adds the
nodes that terminate the chart, which depend on the execution type.
