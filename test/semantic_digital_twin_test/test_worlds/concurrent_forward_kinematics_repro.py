"""
Regression script for a fixed segfault in concurrent forward-kinematics composition.

Not a test module (pytest never collects it): it is run in its own subprocess by
test_forward_kinematics_thread_safety.py, because the failure it used to reproduce was a
native crash that would take the whole pytest process down if triggered in-process.

The crash used to happen because ``World.compose_forward_kinematics_expression`` is
``@copy_memoize``: concurrent cache misses for the same key raced to both compute and
write the per-owner cache with no lock (krrood.patterns.caching.copy_memoize), and two
threads could end up calling ``deepcopy`` on the same cached CasADi-backed object at the
same time. The computation also built HomogeneousTransformationMatrix results via
SymbolicMathType.from_casadi_sx(), which used to alias rather than copy its input, and
HomogeneousTransformationMatrix._verify_type() writes into that casadi_sx in place. With
enough concurrent callers, two threads ended up reading and writing overlapping CasADi
SX objects with no synchronization anywhere in that chain, which corrupted CasADi's
internal (non-atomic) reference counting and crashed natively. ``memoize``/
``copy_memoize`` now serialise each cached result, and the aliasing call sites now copy,
so this script is expected to run to completion without crashing.
