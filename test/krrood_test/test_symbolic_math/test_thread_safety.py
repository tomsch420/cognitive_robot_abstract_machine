"""
Thread-safety behaviour of :mod:`krrood.symbolic_math.symbolic_math`.

Building and compiling expressions from multiple threads, each owning its own
:class:`~krrood.symbolic_math.symbolic_math.CompiledFunction`, is safe even when the
threads share the same :class:`~krrood.symbolic_math.symbolic_math.FloatVariable`
instances or the same source expression. Sharing one *compiled* function across threads
is also safe: :meth:`CompiledFunction.__call__` binds arguments into, and evaluates
from, a single reusable output buffer to avoid allocating on every call, and that
bind-then-evaluate sequence is serialised by a per-instance lock.
