"""
Tests for disjunction factoring: an OR whose disjuncts are all value comparisons on the
*same* subject chain is said with the subject and copula stated once and only the
predicate tails coordinated — *"the battery of a Robot is greater than 50 or less than
10"* — rather than repeating *"the battery of … is …"* per disjunct.

The disjunction is inclusive, so it is *not* fronted with *"either"* (which would read
as exclusive-or).
