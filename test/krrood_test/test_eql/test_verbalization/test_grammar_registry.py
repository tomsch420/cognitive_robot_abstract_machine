"""
The ``RULES`` registry auto-discovers every concrete grammar rule by walking the grammar package,
rather than hand-maintaining a list of imports — so adding a construct's ``rules`` module needs no
edit to the registry. ``concrete_subclasses`` is the single subclass-discovery primitive shared by
the registry and the :class:`SpecificityRule` families.
