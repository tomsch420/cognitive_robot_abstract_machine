"""
Characterization (golden) tests that widen the black-box safety net before the verbalization
refactor (:doc:`/eql/developer/verbalization_refactor_plan`).

They pin the *current* rendered English for behaviours the existing suite under-covers — multi-way
coordination/folding, mixed nesting, double negation, and plural-subject agreement across the whole
realisation pipeline — so a structural refactor that must preserve output has a tight regression
net. They assert through the public API (``verbalize_expression``) only, so they survive any internal
restructuring.

.. note::
    These record behaviour as-is, not as-desired. Where the current output is itself a simplification
    opportunity (e.g. double negation is *not* collapsed), that is captured as a fact to preserve
    until a phase deliberately changes it (with its own test).
