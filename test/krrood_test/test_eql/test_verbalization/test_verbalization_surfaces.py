"""
Golden-surface snapshot over every symbolic callable krrood defines.

Uses the reusable
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.verbalization.surface_verification.SymbolicSurfaceSnapshot`:
it discovers every concrete Predicate / SymbolicFunction in the ``krrood`` package, renders each with
placeholder operands, and checks it against the committed snapshot in :mod:`verbalization_surfaces`
(one :class:`~...surface_verification.VerbalizationSurface` per class). Every covered class must
implement a fragment; a fragment-less class, an uncovered class, or a changed wording each fails.

When an intentional change alters a surface, the match test prints each class and its new sentence;
update that class's entry in ``verbalization_surfaces.py`` and commit it (the diff is the review
record). A newly added symbolic callable fails the coverage test until it gets an entry.
