"""
Golden-surface snapshot over every symbolic callable's verbalization.

Every concrete :class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.predicate.Predicate` /
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.predicate.SymbolicFunction` defined in krrood's source is
rendered with placeholder operands and compared against the committed snapshot
(``verbalization_surfaces.yaml``, one ``qualified class name: sentence`` entry per class). Every
covered class must implement a fragment: a fragment-less class fails
:func:`test_every_covered_symbolic_callable_has_a_verbalization_fragment` rather than being rendered
or silently skipped.

The point is review visibility: adding or renaming a symbolic callable, or changing the shared
surface builders, makes the affected sentences appear as diff lines in the snapshot file, so the
author and every reviewer see — and can object to — the exact wording a class produces, without
anyone writing a per-class test.

To update the snapshot after an intentional change, set ``UPDATE_SNAPSHOT = True`` (below) and run::

    pytest test/krrood_test/test_eql/test_verbalization/test_verbalization_surfaces.py

then restore ``UPDATE_SNAPSHOT = False`` and commit the regenerated YAML with the change that caused it.
