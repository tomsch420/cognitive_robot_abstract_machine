"""
Grounding a scalar confounder alongside an exchangeable relation.

The scenario: a :class:`~test.krrood_test.dataset.example_classes.PickingRobot` has a
``skill`` level that confounds its :class:`~test.krrood_test.dataset.example_classes.GraspAttempt`
attempts — skill affects both the arm position chosen (the cause) and the grasp
outcome (the effect) directly, so the naive (non-adjusted) correlation between arm and
outcome is biased and only backdoor-adjusting for skill recovers the true causal
effect. This is the shape any relational causal query needs before a
:class:`~probabilistic_model.probabilistic_circuit.causal.causal_circuit.CausalCircuit`
could be built on top of it: a class-level scalar alongside an exchangeable relation
whose own aggregation statistics may or may not be determined by the query.

These tests exercise ``RelationalProbabilisticCircuit.ground()`` for that shape,
independently of any further question about backdoor-criterion validity.
