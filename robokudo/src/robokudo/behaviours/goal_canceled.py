"""
Goal cancellation behavior for RoboKudo behavior trees.

This module provides a behavior that checks for goal cancellation by monitoring
error states on the behavior tree's blackboard. It is used to:

* Detect when goals should be canceled due to errors
* Provide clean termination of action sequences
* Support error handling in action servers

The behavior integrates with RoboKudo's error handling system to detect
conditions that should trigger goal cancellation.

    It is typically used in action server implementations to handle error
