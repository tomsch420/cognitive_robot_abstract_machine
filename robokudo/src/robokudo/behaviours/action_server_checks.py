"""
Action server monitoring behaviors for RoboKudo behavior trees.

This module provides behaviors for monitoring and controlling ROS action servers
in RoboKudo. It includes behaviors for:

* Checking action server activity state
* Handling preemption requests
* Managing goal abortion
* Exception handling

These behaviors are typically used in pipelines that interact with ROS action
servers to ensure proper state management and error handling.
