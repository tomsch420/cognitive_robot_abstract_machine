"""Scene representation types for Robokudo.

This module provides types for representing and analyzing elements in a scene.
It includes types for:

* Analyzable scene elements
* Object and human hypotheses
* Region definitions
* Part-whole relationships
* Occupancy annotations

The types support 3D point clouds, image ROIs, and nested annotations.

    In contrast to ObjectHypothesis, we have many different aspects on a Object to annotate.
    Therefore, the semantics of self.points, self.centroid and self.roi on this Hypothesis are a bit different.
    These variables should always contain the maximum region of the person we have been able to detect so far.
    Examples:
      - When running only a face detection, they should be adjusted to the ROI for the face.
      - When running a full body detection + face detection,
        they should be adjusted to everything the full body detection and the face recognition was able to see.
        Basically a Union over the ROIs generated for both.
    In general, PersonHypotheses should rely more on Annotations and also annotate the individual detected features,
    like body parts or activities.

    Parthood Annotations are still a Hypothesis, because due to bad pose estimation we might actually not
