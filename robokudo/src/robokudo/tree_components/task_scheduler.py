"""Task scheduling components for behavior trees.

This module provides base classes for implementing task schedulers in behavior trees.
Task schedulers are responsible for dynamically arranging and managing behavior tree
nodes during execution.

The module supports:

* Dynamic behavior arrangement
* Task scheduling policies
* Job sequence management
* Tree structure validation
