"""
Enhanced parallel behavior tree components.

This module provides enhanced parallel behavior tree components that improve upon
the standard py_trees parallel implementation. It supports:

* Configurable success policies
* Synchronization options
* Child status management
* Improved interrupt handling

The module is primarily used for:

* Complex parallel task execution
* Synchronized behavior coordination
* Robust failure handling
