"""
Behavior tree utilities for RoboKudo.

This module provides helper functions for working with py_trees behavior trees.
It supports:

* Traversing trees while excluding certain node types
* Finding nodes by type or name
* Setting up trees and their descendants
* Managing parent-child relationships
* Generating scoped names for behaviors

Dependencies:

* py_trees for behavior tree functionality
* py_trees_ros for ROS integration
