"""
Common behavior patterns for RoboKudo pipelines.

This module provides reusable behavior patterns that are commonly used in
RoboKudo pipelines. These patterns encapsulate standard combinations of
annotators and behaviors that are frequently needed together.

The module provides:

* Standard initialization sequences for pipelines
* Common error handling patterns
* Reusable behavior combinations
