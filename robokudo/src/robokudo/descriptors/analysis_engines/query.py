"""
Analysis engine for handling query-based processing.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to implement
query-based processing in a pipeline. It shows how to set up a pipeline that
can receive queries, process them using camera data, and return responses.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Query reception and handling
* Kinect camera data processing
* Query response generation
* Action server status checking

.. note::
    This is a basic query handling pipeline that can be extended with additional
    processing steps between query reception and response generation.

    Analysis engine for query-based processing.

    This class implements a pipeline that handles incoming queries by processing

    * Query reception through QueryAnnotator
    * Camera data collection and preprocessing
    * Query response generation
    * Action server status monitoring
