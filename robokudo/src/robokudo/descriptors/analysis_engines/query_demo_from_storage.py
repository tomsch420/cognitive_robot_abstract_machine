"""
Analysis engine for demonstrating query processing with stored data.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates query-based processing
using stored camera data from MongoDB. It implements a pipeline that combines
query handling with tabletop segmentation and color analysis.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Query handling through action server
* Reading stored camera data from MongoDB
* Image preprocessing and point cloud analysis
* Object segmentation and color analysis
* Query response generation

.. note::
    This demo combines query processing capabilities with stored data analysis,
    making it useful for testing and debugging query-based object analysis
    without requiring live camera input.
