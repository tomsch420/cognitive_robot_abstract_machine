"""
Analysis engine for visualizing stored annotations.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to read and display
data and annotations that have been previously stored in a MongoDB database. It
implements a simple pipeline for retrieving and visualizing stored object
hypotheses.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:
- Reading stored data from MongoDB
- Image preprocessing
- Visualization of stored object hypotheses

.. note::
    This engine requires pre-existing data in the MongoDB database. Make sure to
    store some annotated data before running this pipeline.
