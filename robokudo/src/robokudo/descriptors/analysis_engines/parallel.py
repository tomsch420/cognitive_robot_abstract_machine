"""
Analysis engine demonstrating parallel processing capabilities.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to implement
parallel processing within a pipeline. It shows how to configure and execute
multiple annotators concurrently using a parallel execution policy.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Kinect camera data input
* Pipeline trigger for controlled execution
* Parallel execution of slow annotators
* Synchronized completion policy

.. note::
    This is a demonstration pipeline that uses simulated slow annotators to
    illustrate parallel processing behavior. The annotators have different
    sleep durations to show asynchronous execution.
