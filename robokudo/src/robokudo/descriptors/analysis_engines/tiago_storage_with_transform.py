"""
Analysis engine for recording TIAGo sensor data with transforms.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to record sensor
data from a TIAGo robot's camera system while preserving transformation data.
It implements a pipeline that captures, preprocesses, and stores camera data
along with associated coordinate transforms.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Reading data from TIAGo's camera
* Image preprocessing
* Data storage with transform information

.. note::
    This engine uses the TIAGo camera configuration with transform lookup
    enabled, ensuring that coordinate transformations are properly recorded
    along with the sensor data.
