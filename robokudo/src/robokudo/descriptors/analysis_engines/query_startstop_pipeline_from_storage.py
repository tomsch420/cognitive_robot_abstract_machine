"""
Analysis engine for continuous perception with start/stop control.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to implement a
continuous perception pipeline with external start/stop control through an
action server. It processes stored camera data and can be started, stopped,
and preempted by external commands.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Query-based start/stop control
* Continuous processing of stored camera data
* Image preprocessing and point cloud analysis
* Object segmentation and visualization
* Automatic failure after 30 iterations
* Preemption handling

.. note::
    This engine demonstrates how to implement a long-running perception pipeline
    that can be controlled externally through ROS action server commands.

.. warning::
    The pipeline is designed to fail after 30 iterations to demonstrate
    error handling and recovery mechanisms.
