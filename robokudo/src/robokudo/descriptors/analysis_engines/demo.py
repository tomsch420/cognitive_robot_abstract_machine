"""
Analysis engine demonstrating basic tabletop segmentation.

This module provides a basic analysis engine that demonstrates tabletop
segmentation using a Kinect camera. It implements a straightforward pipeline
for processing point cloud data to identify objects on a table surface.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:
- Reading data from a Kinect camera (without transform lookup)
- Image preprocessing
- Point cloud cropping
- Plane detection (table surface)
- Point cloud cluster extraction (objects)

.. note::
    This is a basic demonstration pipeline that can be used as a starting point
    for more complex object detection and segmentation tasks.
