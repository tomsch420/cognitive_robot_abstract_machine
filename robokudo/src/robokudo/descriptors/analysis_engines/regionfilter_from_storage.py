"""
Analysis engine for region-based filtering using world descriptors.

This module provides an analysis engine that demonstrates how to filter point
cloud data based on predefined regions from world descriptors. It processes stored
camera data and applies region-based filtering to focus on specific areas of
interest.

The pipeline implements the following functionality:

* Reading stored camera data from MongoDB
* Image preprocessing
* Region-based filtering using world descriptor data
* Optional pipeline trigger for step-by-step execution
* Optional camera viewpoint visualization

.. note::
    This engine requires properly configured world descriptors with defined regions
    of interest. The regions are used to filter the point cloud data during
    processing.
