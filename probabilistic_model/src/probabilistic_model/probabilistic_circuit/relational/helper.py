    Rename each variable in the circuit to include ``prefix`` as a namespace.

    Variables listed in ``excluded_variables`` are left unchanged. ``prefix`` is
    a full match-tree path (e.g. ``"EGShelf.layers[0]"``, from ``str(part.variable)``),
    not a single namespace segment. At nesting depth >= 2, a variable arriving here
    may already have been fully qualified by a deeper part's own prefixing (e.g. an
    "objects" part mounted into this "layers" part already carries a name like
    ``"EGShelf.layers[0].objects[0].scale.height"``); such variables are left
    unchanged too, since prefixing them again would duplicate the path
    (``"EGShelf.layers[0].EGShelf.layers[0].objects[0].scale.height"``) and produce a
    name nothing downstream looks up, silently leaving that field unresolved.
