Bridges ``RelationalProbabilisticCircuit`` grounding into ``CausalCircuit``

.. note::
    This module mirrors how ``rspn.py`` deliberately bridges ``probabilistic_model``
    and ``krrood``: it is the seam where relational grounding meets exact causal
    inference, kept separate from both ``rspn.py`` and ``causal_circuit.py`` so
    neither needs to depend on the other.
